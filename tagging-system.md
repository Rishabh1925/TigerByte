# üêÖ TigerByte Issue Tagging System Proposal

## Introduction

This report outlines the proposed standardized tagging system for the `TigerByte` repository. The system is designed to significantly improve issue discoverability, enforce clarity and consistency across the workflow, and infuse the project with unique, engaging tags.

## Current Tags

**(NOTE: This section is based on standard GitHub defaults as current repo tags were unavailable.)**

| Tag Name | Assumed Color (Hex) | Category | Identified Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bug` | `#d73a4a` (Red) | Type | Needs a color with higher contrast (e.g., darker red). |
| `documentation` | `#0075ca` (Blue) | Type | Good, but should be specialized (e.g., `type: docs`). |
| `help wanted` | `#008672` (Teal) | Contributor | Good. Needs clear pairing with "beginner" tags. |
| `enhancement` | `#a2eeef` (Light Cyan) | Type | Good. |

## Proposed Tags: TigerByte Tagging System

The following system uses seven distinct categories, ordered for consistency (Status first, Events last).

### Tag Order

1.  Status Tags (Workflow & State)
2.  Priority Tags (Urgency)
3.  Type of Issue Tags (Classification)
4.  Area/Component Tags (Code Location)
5.  Contributor-Focused Tags (Onboarding & Help)
6.  TigerByte-Specific Tags (Creative Identity)
7.  Special Event/Seasonal Tags (External Focus)
